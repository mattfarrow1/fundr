\usage{
donor_status(
  last_gift_date,
  as_of = Sys.Date(),
  fy_start_month = 7L,
  lapsed_years = 5L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{last_gift_date}{Date vector of most recent gift dates (or coercible
via \code{as.Date()}). Use NA for constituents who have never given.}

\item{as_of}{Reference date for status calculation. Default is today.}

\item{fy_start_month}{Integer 1-12 indicating fiscal year start month.
Default 7 (July).}

\item{lapsed_years}{Number of years with no gifts before a donor is
considered "Lapsed". Default 5.}
}
\value{
Ordered factor with levels: "Active", "LYBUNT", "SYBUNT",
"Lapsed", "Never" (from most to least engaged).
}
\description{
Categorizes donors based on their last gift date relative to the current
fiscal year. This is fundamental for advancement reporting and outreach
segmentation.
}
\details{
Status definitions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Active}: Gave during the current fiscal year
\item \strong{LYBUNT}: "Last Year But Unfortunately Not This" - gave
last fiscal year but not yet this year
\item \strong{SYBUNT}: "Some Year But Unfortunately Not This" - gave
2+ fiscal years ago but within the lapsed threshold
\item \strong{Lapsed}: Last gift was more than \code{lapsed_years} ago
\item \strong{Never}: No gift on record (NA last_gift_date)
}
