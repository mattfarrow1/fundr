\title{Calculate age from partial birthdate}
\usage{
calc_age_partial(birthdate, as_of = Sys.Date(), assume_midpoint = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{birthdate}{Character, numeric, or Date vector of birthdates.
Partial dates (year-only, year-month) are accepted.}

\item{as_of}{Reference date for age calculation. Default is today.}

\item{assume_midpoint}{Logical. If TRUE (default), assumes midpoint for
missing components (July 1 for year-only, 15th for month-only).
If FALSE, uses January 1 and 1st respectively.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of ages in years. Returns NA for NA inputs,
unparseable dates, or future birthdates.
}
\description{
Extends \code{\link[=calc_age]{calc_age()}} to work with partial dates. When only year or
year-month is known, uses mid-point assumptions for more accurate
age estimation.
}
\examples{
# Year only - assumes July 1 as midpoint
calc_age_partial("1980")

# Year-month - assumes 15th as midpoint
calc_age_partial("1980-06")

# Full date
calc_age_partial("1980-06-15")

# Vectorized
calc_age_partial(c("1980", "1990-06", "2000-12-25"))
